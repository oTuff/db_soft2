This report included emissions from electricity and natural gas consumption, vehicles, city-owned landfills, municipal solid waste (MSW) generated inside the city but sent to landfills outside city limits, and emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), and the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (excluding aviation fuel emissions).

These are not insignificant numbers, but if the City and community come together in working towards those same goals, we can surely achieve them.

      "Comment": "Reduction GoalsSubsequent to the completion of the 2007 GHG emissions inventory, the City established the following emissions reduction targets: Short-term: Reduction of 20% below 2007 levels by 2020 *Equals 1.5% annual reduction until 2020 Long-term: Reduction of 80% below 2007 levels by 2050 *Equals 2% annual reduction between 2020 and 2050 To achieve its 2020 goal, the City would have to reduce the emissions generated by its municipal operations by 4,657 tons of CO2 equivalent, while the community-wide emissions reduction would have to approach 86,485 tons of CO2 equivalent. These are not insignificant numbers, but if the City and community come together in working towards those same goals, we can surely achieve them. Exploration of new technologies, new financial incentives and/or financing schemes, as well as a general willingness and commitment to the implementation of this plan will bring success."

This makes New York the largest city to commit to the 80 percent reduction by 2050, and charts a long-term path for investment in renewable sources of energy and a total transition from fossil fuels.\\n\\nNearly three quarters of New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions come from energy used to heat, cool, and power buildings, making building retrofits a central component of any plan to dramatically reduce emissions.\\n\\nThe City is poised to make direct investments to increase the efficiency of its public buildings, including schools and public housing, reducing the government’s contribution to climate change and generating operational savings for New York City taxpayers. Every single city-owned building with any significant energy use – approximately 3,000 buildings – will be retrofitted within the next ten years, by 2025, with interim goals along the way."

EPA's non road emissions model was used for off road vehicles\\n\\nIndustrial emissions were estimated by looking at EPAs GHG reporting project data and comparing it to previously known information from utilities.\\n\\nWaste data was modeled using MSW and private collection data along with local landfill and incinerator emissions based on total waste. This was counted as a scope 3 emissions because none of these facilities are within the City of Philadelphia"

Actual measurements are available for electricity, natural gas, and steam (obtained directly from energy utilities), and all sources related to mass transit, the airport, and water and sewer (obtained from the regional authorities). Regional transportation models are used to calculate vehicle-miles-traveled in Boston, which are then split into diesel and gasoline based on the State diesel and gas consumption split. Then each fuel type is divided into the average fleet mix categories (ICLEI 2009) and the EPA emissions factor for each vehicle type are applied to calculate the GHG. A 10% ethanol content for gasoline is also accounted for.  Fuel oil consumption is estimated based on sampling, U.S. Census data, and some state consumption figures."

A Lei de Clima do DF também determinou a internalização da dimensão climática no planejamento da malha viária e da oferta dos diferentes modais de transportes. Determinou também o estabelecimento de limites e metas de redução progressiva e a promoção do monitoramento das emissões dos GEE pelo sistema de transporte do DF. Além disso, para o sistema de transporte público, a Lei determina uma redução progressiva do uso de combustíveis fósseis e meta progressiva de redução de, pelo menos, 10% a cada ano, a partir de 2011. Em 2020, de acordo com a Lei de Clima do DF, todos os ônibus do sistema de transporte público do Distrito Federal estarão utilizando combustível renovável não fóssil. A Lei também prevê redução do desmatamento e de decisões de fortalecimento das remoções antrópicas por sumidouros de gases de efeito estufa no território."

Out-of-boundary activities critical to a community such as the provision of food, water, fuels and dwellings are added to the in-boundary activities to yield an expanded inventory that becomes a more comprehensive “carbon emissions footprint”.\\n\\nIn 2015, the City of Lakewood worked with a GHG emissions analyst and updated the 2007 report figures based on more accurate electricity and surface transportation emission factors."

As I understand scope 1 this is scope 1 emissions, due to activities of citizens and businesses within the city limits, waste and flight / shipping. Emissions from energy generation is not included. That kind of emission is though very low as our energy and district heating runs on Hydro power and geothermal heat. We are not counting emissions from activities outside of the borders of the city, such as emissions from the international airport which is outside of Reykjavik and not the emissions of any production outside of the city which I understand is scope 3."
